# Goal of this Project
I intend to first implement the provided DNS implementation in python, then implement it in Go as a way to introduce myself to the language.
# Important Notes
The source for this project is https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/. As the guide notes, this is a toy implementation, and I do not intend to bring its complexity up beyond that, this project is just a simple exercise in a protocol I am interested in and to shake the rust off my software skills.
